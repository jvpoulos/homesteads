     SUMMARY: This data collection contains preliminary  financial  data        
     on  state government revenues and expenditures for 48 states during        
     the period 1790-1915, plus final data on state government revenues,        
     expenditures,  and debt for Missouri during 1849-1915, Parts 95 and        
     96.  Parts 98 and 99, Final  Raw  Data  on  Missouri  Revenues  and        
     Expenditures, are similar to Parts 95 and 96, with two differences.        
     First, they contain every line entry that was transcribed from  the        
     original  source.  Second,  the  files  have a line identifier that        
     shows the order in which the data came from  the  original  source.        
     Variables  in  the  data collection include state, year, and dollar        
     amounts of revenues and expenditures at four levels of aggregation:        
     (1)  total  expenditures  and  revenues,  (2) major categories that        
     match  the  major  20th-century  categories  of  expenditures   and        
     revenues,  (3) minor categories that correspond to special features        
     of 19th- and/or 20th-century  governments,  and  (4)  idiosyncratic        
     categories that differ from state to state. Part 100 contains codes        
     for categories of expenditures, revenues, and debt for Parts 95-97.

     Economic Research, or ISR bear any responsibility for the analysis or      
     interpretations presented here. Nor are they responsible for any uses      
     to which this data may be put.                                             
                                                                                
             Individuals receiving and using this data are strongly urged       
     to inform the ISR and the principle investigators of any errors or         
     discrepancies discovered during the use of this data. In order to          
     provide agencies with essential information about the use of archival

             This codebook describes the "preliminary" release of state         
     financial data collected by Richard Sylla, John Legler, and John           
     Wallis under NSF Grants SES-8419857, SES-8706814, and SES- 8908272.        
     This data is part of a larger data set containing information on           
     state and local government finances between 1790 and 1980. The             
     current data set contains information on state government revenues         
     and expenditures between, approximately, 1790 and 1915. The initial        
     release of the data includes information for thirty three states.          
     Subsequent releases of preliminary data, and revisions of preliminary      
     data sets, will occur as the data becomes available. Final versions        
     of the data should be prepared by 1994.                                    
                                                                                
             It must be recognized that this is a PRELIMINARY data set.         
     There are many, multi-dimensional holes in the data. The most obvious      
     is missing years. Less obvious are, as yet, uncorrected problems of        
     misclassification, double counting, and inadvertent omission of            
     relevant data. In other words, caveat emptor]                              
                                                                                
                                                                                
     DATA COLLECTION AND CODING                                                 
                                                                                
             We began collecting data with three objectives in mind. The        
     first was to make our categories consistent with the existing              
     categories used by the census in the 20th century, so that we can          
     match our data with theirs. The second was to facilitate the               
     collection of the data. This was particularly important since we           
     typically face the problem of too much rather than too little              
     information. A method for organizing detail without losing                 
     information was of primary importance. Finally, we needed a method         
     that could be followed independently by the three principal                
     investigators operating at some distances from one another.                
                                                                                
             The solution adopted resembles the standard industrial             
     classification (SIC) codes. Expenditures, revenues, and debt are           
     given one-digit classifications; major categories that match the           
     major 20th-century categories are given two-digit classifications;         
     minor categories that correspond to the special features of 19th-          
     and/or 20th-century features of government are given three-digit           
     codes; and idiosyncratic divisions, which differ from state to state       
     are given unique four-digit codes in each state. This allows us to         
     design a classification (coding) scheme for each state at the              
     four-digit level that can be aggregated into two- and three-digit          
     categories that are identical for every state by using a simple            
     sorting program.                                                           
                                                                                
             No coding scheme can be completely consistent with the census      
     classifications, since the census has continually changed its              
     classifications over the twentieth century.  We, therefore, started        
     with the major divisions of revenues and expenditures from the Census      
     of Governments after 1960. To that we added the major revenue and          
     expenditure categories from the census for early part of the century

 Page 4                                           ICPSR 9728                    
                                                                                
                                                                                
     excluded as categories after 1950. The result is the major categories      
     listed in Tables 1 and 2. These are the major two-digit                    
     classifications.                                                           
                                                                                
             Finer classifications, taken from actual census categories         
     and from our own experience with the 19th century data, make up a set      
     of three-digit categories. The three digit categories are subsets of       
     the two-digit categories. In other words, the sum of all of the            
     three-digit categories associated with a particular two-digit              
     category, is the total for that two-digit category. So the sum of the      
     three digit codes 2110 through 2190, is equal to the total for the         
     two-digit code 2100. The three-digit codes are shown in Tables 3 and       
     4.                                                                         
                                                                                
             In practice, the raw data is very heterogeneous. States            
     called similar financial items by different names, different items by      
     similar names, and classified debt and intragovernmental transfers in      
     different ways. Therefore, a unique set of four-digit classifications      
     was created for each state. That is, while all of the one-, two-, and      
     three-digit codes are the same in every state, the four-digit codes        
     are different for every state.                                             
                                                                                
             We begin the collection process by assigning a four-digit          
     code to every line entry on revenues and expenditures in the source        
     document (these are discussed below). The raw financial data and the       
     codes were then entered into a spreadsheet file using Lotus. The data      
     were then transferred to a Paradox database file where the data are        
     sorted and aggregated by code.  Then totals for each of the                
     three-digit classifications are calculated.  Since the three-digit         
     classifications are the same for every state, we then have comparable      
     financial statistics for every state.                                      
                                                                                
             The current data release does not include the four-digit           
     files.  We are willing to let people have access to them, and the          
     final data release will include them.  The four-digit files, however,      
     are really only useful in connection with the source documents.  Code      
     2924 doesn't mean the same thing in Vermont as it does in Tennessee,       
     although 2920 does mean the same thing (at least in our judgement:         
     dividends from bank stock).  In order to make sense of the four-digit      
     codes, then, you need our classification sheets for each state and         
     the original source document.                                              
                                                                                
                                                                                
     DATA SOURCES                                                               
                                                                                
             What then are these source documents? We went back to the          
     existing record of state governments, primarily Treasurer's Reports,       
     Auditor's Reports, and Comptroller's Reports. After 1840 or so most        
     of these documents are available at the Library of Congress. Before        
     1840 we have relied on the LC/University of North Carolina Microfilm       
     record of state government documents and trips to state archives. The

     first step was to determine which of the available reports was most        
     useful. The second step was to xerox the documents.                        
                                                                                
             We brought the documents back to our respective Universities       
     and set research assistants to "coding" the documents. This required       
     that each financial entry, each line of the Report be given an             
     appropriate four-code. The data was then entered into the computer in      
     the following form:

                 the current fiscal period ended.

             The data is organized vertically rather than horizontally.         
     The "observation" is a line entry from the source document, coupled        
     with is state, year, and code. This allowed us the maximum of              
     flexibility in using database capabilities.                                
                                                                                
             It was then a simple process to add up the individual four-        
     digit numbers into four-digit totals, and do likewise for three-,          
     two-, and one-digit totals. The last three sets of totals, for             
     revenues and expenditures are on the data tapes accompanying this          
     codebook.

             The data tapes that you are trying to figure out how use have      
     a simple structure. There are two data files for each state: one for       
     revenues and one for expenditures. Each file begins with a two digit       
     alphanumeric states abbreviation (we use the postal abbreviations)         
     followed by _REV.ISR for revenues and _EXP.ISR for expenditures.           
                                                                                
             The files are ASCII files, using a comma to delimit                
     variables. Each file contains three sub-files. Each sub-file contains

             I will use Oklahoma as an example, since the whole revenue         
     file can be printed on one page. It is shown in Table 5. (We only          
     have data for three years on Oklahoma, 1908, 1909, and 1911).              
                                                                                
             The first sub-file gives the revenue totals, this is the 1-        
     digit sub-file. The ISO code for total revenues is "1". There is a         
     blank line at the end of the 1-digit sub-file.                             
                                                                                
             The 2-digit sub-file includes all 2-digit ISO codes (for           
     revenues they all start with 1 or 2, for expenditures with 3 or 4).        
     There is a blank line at the end of the 2-digit sub-file.                  
                                                                                
             The 3-digit sub-file includes all 3-digit ISO codes (for           
     revenues they all start with 1 or 2, for expenditures with 3 or 4).        
     There is a blank line at the end of the 3-digit sub-file.

             Each state has data on six sub-files. These files can be           
     broken up and entered separately, or they can be entered all at once.      
     For example, one could easily combine the revenue and expenditure          
     files and enter the entire file into a database program and sort by        
     codes.

     IMPORTANT CAVEATS                                                          
                                                                                
             There are several things you should be aware of, even when         
     there are not any problems with the underlying data:                       
                                                                                
          - Total Revenues have the code "1" and Total Expenditures have        
            the code "3".                                                       
                                                                                
          - Two- and three-digit revenues have codes that start with the        
            number "1" or "2"; two- and three-digit expenditures have           
            codes that start with the number "3" or "4". So adding up all       
            of the two digit codes from 1000 to 1999 will not give you          
            total revenues.                                                     
                                                                                
          - There is a difference between 1000 numbers and 2000 numbers.        
            They correspond to the early 20th century categories of "tax"       
            and "non-tax" revenues. There is no comparable meaning to the       
            3000 and 4000 numbers.                                              
                                                                                
          - Most of the two-digit codes are straightforward. That is, all       
            of the three digit codes they encompass refer to related            
            aspects of fiscal activity. On the other hand, SOME TWO-DIGIT       
            CODES ENCOMPASS THREE-DIGIT CODES THAT HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH      
            EACH OTHER.  This is particularly true for the "miscellaneous"      
            and "not elsewhere classified" categories 2900 and 3900. If         
            you use the two-digit codes, it is wise to examine the              
            underlying three-digit codes.                                       
                                                                                
          - Because this a preliminary data set there may be some problems      
            using three-digit codes. You may find a three-digit code in         
            the data that is not listed in Table 3 or 4. We can go back to      
            the original files and find out what the code is for you.           
            Careful comparison of all the codes across states is the next       
            stage in the project.                                               
                                                                                
                                                                                
             There is another set of substantive caveats that the wary          
     user must keep in mind.                                                    
                                                                                
                                                                                
          - THIS IS PRELIMINARY DATA. The data has been carefully checked       
            for errors in transcription and coding, undoubtedly some            
            remain, but they are not systematic. There are, however,            
            systematic errors in coding that occur when a research              
            assistant uses the wrong code unwittingly; when one of the          
            PI's makes a mistake in telling an RA how something should be       
            coded; or when we misunderstand (or simply don't understand)        
            what an line entry is in a particular state report.  We still       
            hundreds of coding decisions to be made before the final            
            version of the data is ready to release. For the moment you         
            have the best we could do in the first pass through the data.

            We do not guarantee that the coding will not change.                
                                                                                
          - There are many wild codes. At this point in time, we have not       
            gone back to fix problems that we could not solve on the first      
            pass through the data. You WILL find codes like 9999 or 9990.       
            Those codes are for entries which we have yet to figure out.        
            You will also find codes number 6000, which correspond to           
            transfers between funds.  These codes may (or may not) be           
            taken out of the final data set.                                    
                                                                                
             Occasionally RA's used their own shorthand codes for things.       
     Unfortunately some of these codes did not contain four digits (e.g.        
     some people used the code 1 or 100 to represent general fund               
     revenues). Because of the Paradox routines used to generate the            
     aggregated files, these codes sometimes get rounded to "0".  In other      
     cases a 2-digit code will only have one digit (e.g.  divide the code       
     100 by 100 and take the integer portion and you get a code "1") or a       
     three digit code will have only two digits.  The sub-files keep the        
     true one-, two-, and three- digit totals separate. You could,              
     however, accidentally combine some of the two- and three- digit            
     totals by entering all of the data and then sorting by code. So be         
     careful.                                                                   
                                                                                
          - There is no adjustment for fiscal years. This has two               
            dimensions to it. First, states periodically changed the end        
            dates on their fiscal years. This produced some nine month          
            fiscal years and some 15 month fiscal years. When possible we       
            adjusted for this in the original coding (when it was possible      
            to break out quarterly expenditures and revenues, for               
            example). In other cases we simply have to take what is given       
            to us.  In time, we will make adjustments to the data               
            (probably some type of weighted linear interpolation), but          
            these data do not include any such adjustments.                     
                                                                                
             Second, you will not be able to tell whether a state is on a       
     two-year fiscal cycle, in which case this data set will only report a      
     number for every other year; or whether a state is on an annual            
     fiscal cycle and we just happened to miss a year or, as fate would         
     have it, every other year for a decade or so. It may sound unlikely,       
     but there are over 4,000 years of data in this sample and lots of          
     unlikely things are possible. Again, this will be fixed in the final       
     data set, but not in this one.                                             
                                                                                
          - These numbers are "self-reported." Total revenues in Vermont        
            is not likely to be exactly the same thing as total revenues        
            in Tennessee. Some states include the proceeds from all loans       
            as revenues, others only short term loans, others none at all.      
            (A classic case occurred in the 1830s when Maryland was in          
            deep financial trouble. It received the federal government          
            surplus payment, which it recorded as a revenue; deposited the      
            money in the bank, which it did not record as an expenditure,;      
                                                                                
                                                                                
1                                                                               
 ICPSR 9728                                           Page 9                    
                                                                                
                                                                                
            then the next year withdrew the money and recorded it as a          
            revenue).  The same thing is true for various classes of            
            expenditures.                                                       
                                                                                
             The current data set makes no allowance for such differences       
     between states. We have not imposed any common conceptual basis on         
     the state accounts. Again, that is something that will come in the         
     future.                                                                    
                                                                                
             This is a problem that you can deal with by paying close           
     attention to some of the three-digit categories like loan revenues,        
     loan repayments, purchase of stock, etc.                                   
                                                                                
          - The accounts of some of the states are horribly convoluted.         
            For example, Washington broke up its accounts into over thirty      
            individual funds, all of which had financial transactions with      
            the "general" fund. There is ample opportunity for double           
            counting when dealing with these states. We have done our           
            level best to take care of the problem. But a brief look at         
            some of the states that were coded early in the project             
            indicates that we still have some work left before all of the       
            double counting problems are taken care of.                         
                                                                                
          - In some cases it was impossible for us to find a                    
            continuous series of one source document, so we had to make do      
            with two. For example, we might have Treasurer's Reports for        
            most years, but be forced to fill in with Auditor's Reports for     
            missing years. Or Treasurer's Reports may have given sufficient     
            details for a period of time, but then changed their format so      
            that Comptroller's reports became more useful sources. The          
            various reports typically report close to the same totals, but      
            the breakdowns in activity often vary widely. Changes in two-       
            and three- digit levels of activity, therefore, may be due to       
            changes in the source. You can check for this by looking at         
            long stretches of data: short-run blips may be the result of        
            changing sources. Again, a problem we will address in the           
            final data set.                                                     
                                                                                
          - Finally, there are several states, where revenues and               
            expenditures come from different reports and, further, the          
            totals in the two reports do not agree. Even worse, we have         
            some states where internal accounts do not agree, although for      
            an understandable reason. Florida is a state where we had to        
            rely on one report for expenditures and another report for          
            revenues and the totals are sometimes significantly different.      
                                                                                
             Other states, Iowa and Washington are the two most egregious       
     offenders, kept revenues and expenditures on different bases.              
     Expenditures were often accounted for by "warrants issued" where the       
     warrants were a kind of check (even this varied, some states issued        
     interest bearing warrants that, apparently, circulated as money            
                                                                                
                                                                                
1                                                                               
 Page 10                                          ICPSR 9728                    
                                                                                
                                                                                
     despite the constitutional prohibition against state monetary issue),      
     while receipts were counted on a cash basis.  Most states that did         
     this "balanced" there account every year, in which case outstanding        
     warrants were simply short term debt.  Some states didn't "balance"        
     their books, at least not in the published reports. The final version      
     of the data will do that balancing, the current version of the data        
     does not.                                                                  
                                                                                
                                                                                
     COVERAGE AND STATUS                                                        
                                                                                
             Because the data set is still being assembled and various          
     states are still in the early coding stages, conveying the exact           
     status of project is complicated. Tables 6 and 7 attempt to do so in       
     a way that may be helpful. Table 6 contains information on the             
     "status" of each state. Aside from the two letter state abbreviation,      
     the three columns include information on the current state of our          
     work on a state.                                                           
                                                                                
             Let me begin by saying that this represents the status of the      
     data that has been assembled in College Park by John Wallis, it is         
     not the status of the whole project or the data at ISR.                    
                                                                                
             If the status column is blank, it means that no data has yet       
     been sent to College Park. Several of these states are essentially         
     complete, but coding work is still going on..                              
                                                                                
             The status "C" indicates that some data is in the computer in      
     College Park, but that we have not yet arranged it in a form that can      
     be transferred to Paradox (more on how much data in a moment). "I"         
     indicates that the available data has been entered into the data           
     inventory which I will discuss shortly -- every state with an "Ill         
     therefore is in this data release.  Intermediate status in indicated       
     by "C/I" and "I/C". Status "C/I" indicates that data in Paradox            
     readable form, but that serious problems remain with interpreting the      
     numbers or using the sources. These states still require a                 
     considerable amount of work. Status "I/C" indicates that the data is       
     in Paradox form, but we are still waiting to fill in or verify part        
     of the series.                                                             
                                                                                
             Although the notation may be cumbersome, it lets you know          
     where we stand. If a state is blank, we can't send you any                 
     information about it yet. If a state is "CI" we could give you data,       
     but we don't trust the data ourselves yet. If a state is "IC" we are       
     close to having it ready to release. If a state is "Ill then all the       
     information we have on the state is included in this data release.         
                                                                                
             Table 7 includes information on the coverage for each state.       
     The table includes the date of statehood and the years for which we        
     have data for all of the states that are currently in the inventory        
     (no matter what their status). As you can see, there are still holes

     appreciate you keeping us informed of the uses to which the data is        
     put. Remember for now: CAVEAT EMPTOR. We will speed clean versions of      
     the data to ISR as becomes available and, we hope, will have a book
