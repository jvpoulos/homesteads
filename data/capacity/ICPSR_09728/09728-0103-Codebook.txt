     SUMMARY: This data collection contains preliminary  financial  data        
     on  state government revenues and expenditures for 48 states during        
     the period 1790-1915, plus final data on state government revenues,        
     expenditures,  and debt for Missouri during 1849-1915, Parts 95 and        
     96.  Parts 98 and 99, Final  Raw  Data  on  Missouri  Revenues  and        
     Expenditures, are similar to Parts 95 and 96, with two differences.        
     First, they contain every line entry that was transcribed from  the        
     original  source.  Second,  the  files  have a line identifier that        
     shows the order in which the data came from  the  original  source.        
     Variables  in  the  data collection include state, year, and dollar        
     amounts of revenues and expenditures at four levels of aggregation:        
     (1)  total  expenditures  and  revenues,  (2) major categories that        
     match  the  major  20th-century  categories  of  expenditures   and        
     revenues,  (3) minor categories that correspond to special features        
     of 19th- and/or 20th-century  governments,  and  (4)  idiosyncratic        
     categories that differ from state to state. Part 100 contains codes        
     for categories of expenditures, revenues, and debt for Parts 95-97.

         This codebook describes the "final" release of data for the            
    State of Missouri.  This data was collected by Richard Sylla,               
    John Legler, and John Wallis under NSF Grants SES-8419857, SES-             
    8706814, SES-8908272, and SBR-9108618.  This data is part of a              
    larger data set containing information on state and local                   
    government finances between 1790 and 1980.  The current data set            
    contains information on Missouri state  finances beginning in               
    1849 and continuing through 1915.                                           
                                                                                
         We put "final" in quotes.  At present we have been unable to           
    locate any financial records for Missouri before 1849 and we are            
    still missing a few years in the series.  We are also grappling             
    with a few problems of classification.  What then does final                
    mean?                                                                       
                                                                                
         We starting collecting data ten years ago.  We hired                   
    research assistants who went to the Library of Congress and other           
    libraries and xeroxed state financial documents.  In Missouri the           
    relevant document is the Report of the Auditor of Public                    
    Accounts.  We brought the xeroxed documents back to our                     
    respective universities and the RAs began coding revenues,                  
    expenditures, and debts and transcribing the coded figures onto             
    spreadsheets.                                                               
                                                                                
         Despite our best intentions, we realized early in the                  
    process that three PIs working in different parts of the country            
    supervising over twenty RAs, over a ten year period would not be            
    able to insure that the coding process was completely homogenous.           
    So we planned for a third and "final" stage in the data                     
    collection process.                                                         
                                                                                
         John Wallis has gone over the codes and figures for Missouri           
    carefully.  The data in this release for Missouri represent our             
    best efforts at accurately coding individual items of                       
    expenditures, revenues, and debts.  They also represent our best            
    effort at accounting for the appropriate totals of fiscal                   
    activity, making sure that items of expenditure or revenue were             
    not lost in funds reported separately from the Auditor's Report,            
    for example.                                                                
                                                                                
         This data release also includes much more information than             
    our preliminary releases.  There is an essay, if you will, on               
    Missouri finances.  It begins with some basic data: sources of              
    numbers, fiscal years, and missing years.  It continues with a              
    brief sketch of Missouri finances.  Then we try to point out                
    places where we remain uncertain about what to do, and how we               
    resolved problems in interpreting the original sources.  As far             
    as we were able, we have documented any deviations of our figures           
    from the original financial reports.                                        
                                                                                
         It was our intention from the beginning to provide scholars            
    with a user friendly data set.  One that was as clean and                   
    consistent as possible.  This codebook describes the basic design           
    of the data set.  There are four levels of aggregation, and the             
    three highest levels are identical across states.  The fourth is

    unique to Missouri.  By consulting various files it is possible             
    to reconstruct all of the detail we were able to extract from the           
    Missouri records.  We have left nothing out.

    Revenues, Expenditures, and Debts:                                          
                                                                                
         Every file that we have archived with ICPSR is a machine               
    readable ASCII file, with comma delimiters and quote identifiers            
    for alphanumeric variables.                                                 
                                                                                
         Our coding scheme resembles the standard industrial                    
    classification (SIC) codes. Expenditures, revenues, and debt are            
    given one-digit classifications; major categories are given                 
    two-digit classifications; minor categories are given three-digit           
    codes.  To the extent possible, we modeled our major                        
    classifications on 20th-century Census classifications.  But                
    states are highly idiosyncratic and the 19th century is different           
    from the 20th century.  Therefore the four-digit codes are                  
    different in each state.  The codes, though, are nested.  The               
    four-digit sum to the three-digit, the three-digit sum to the               
    two-digit, and the two-digit sum to the one-digit.                          
                                                                                
         We began the collection process by assigning a four-digit              
    code to every line entry on revenues and expenditures in the                
    source document (these are discussed below). The raw financial              
    data and the codes were then entered into a spreadsheet.  The               
    data was then transferred to a database program, sorted, and                
    aggregated by code.

    most important data files are titled:

            TOTAL = the dollar amount of the revenue, expenditure, or           
                    debt.                                                       
                                                                                
         Each file has four panels.  In the first panel there is one            
    observation for each year.  In the revenue file, MOREV.ISR,                 
    ISO = 1; in the expenditure file, MOEXP.ISR ISO = 3.  In the                
    second panel of the file all the ISO codes have two-digits, in              
    the third panel all the ISO codes have three-digits, and in the             
    fourth panel all the ISO codes have four-digits.  Each subsequent           
    panel has more observations, as the detail becomes greater.                 
                                                                                
         You must remember to separate the four panels before you use           
    the data.  The sum of the four-digit codes is total expenditures            
    (revenues), the sum of three-digit codes is total expenditures              
    (revenues), the sum of two-digit codes is total expenditures                
    (revenues), and the one-digit codes are total expenditures                  
    (revenues).  If you don't separate the panels your will find that           
    expenditures and revenues are four times what they should be.               
                                                                                
         The data set is organized as a database, not as a                      
    rectangular data set.  Every expenditure, revenue, and debt is              
    one observation.  Each observation is identified by state, year,            
    and code.                                                                   
                                                                                
         Not every code appears in every year.  If a code does not              
    appear in a given year it either means that the actual value for            
    that code is zero or that it has been aggregated into another               
    category.  It is important to remember that codes appear and                
    disappear for these two reasons.  As the level of aggregation is            
    increased, these problems become less important.

         The second type of information is contained in one file:

         Every ISO code for Missouri is listed in the table, along              
    with the title of that code.  We have done our best to keep the             
    titles in this file as close to the original title given in the             
    Auditor's Report as possible.  Many four digit codes, however,              
    contain more than one title from the Auditor's Report.                      
    Miscellaneous categories, for example, will not include all of              
    the titles from the original source.

         You should pay careful attention to the structure of the               
    two-, three-, and four-digit codes.  Most of the two-digit codes            
    encompass three- and four-digit codes that are related.  But the            
    miscellaneous categories, particularly 1900, 2900, and 3900 are             
    widely divergent.  There is little or no relation between the               
    2910 codes and the 2920 codes, even though they share the same              
    two digit-classification.  Be careful]                                      
                                                                                
                                                                                
    Raw Data:                                                                   
                                                                                
         A third set of data is presented in two files:                         
                                                                                
            MOISRRRR.ISR  -  Raw Data on Missouri Revenues                      
            MOISRXXX.ISR  -  Raw Data on Missouri Expenditures                  
                                                                                
         These files are very similar to the aggregated expenditure             
    and revenue files with two differences.  First, they contain                
    every line entry that we transcribed from the original source.              
    Second, the have a line identifier that shows the order in which            
    the data came from the original source.  So the file's structure            
    is:

         Where line goes from 1 to n, and orders the observations by            
    year and by appearance in the original source.[1]   This file is            
    particularly important if you have access to the original                   
    sources, but want to code your data differently from our coding             
    scheme.  By searching and replacing, you can construct whatever             
    scheme you like.                                                            
                                                                                
                                                                                
    Notes:                                                                      
                                                                                
         The last file is MONOTES.ISR.  This is a more complicated              
    text file.                                                                  
                                                                                
         The first two pages give some basic information about the              
    Missouri data.  First it gives the original source.  Next, the              
    chronological nature of the data:are the reports annual or                  
    biennial, the fiscal years, and the missing years.  Then it gives           
    report types.  Missouri was a "pure fund state."  That means that           
    reconstructing Missouri accounts is very messy.  The state had a            
    general fund a several independent fund.  The Auditor always                
    reported on the general fund, but independent fund transactions             
    were more difficult to trace. (the fund types will be discussed             
    in more detail as final reports for states are made available).             
    Finally the notes list years where "fixes" were necessary.  In              
    these years it was necessary to interpolate, allocate, or                   
    estimate some of the numbers.  The details of the fixes are given

    in the sections that follow.                                                
                                                                                
         The next section is overall comments.  It is the barest                
    outline of a financial history of the state.  The in\\purpose is            
    to make you aware of major features of the state accounts.                  
                                                                                
         The next three sections are "revenue notes," "expenditure              
    notes," and debt notes.  These notes were made as the data was              
    collected and checked.  They are a bit haphazard, but they point            
    to areas where questions about the data remain.  They also                  
    document some of the decisions that we made.  The notes are                 
    intended to be used with the source documents, they will not make           
    much sense without the documents.                                           
                                                                                
                                                                                
         We hope that you will find the data set useful and would               
    appreciate you keeping us informed of the uses to which the data            
    is put.  We have done our best to make sure that the data is                
    consistently coded and organized.  We are willing to use the data           
    in this form without too many reservations. Any comments or                 
    suggestions will be greatly appreciated.

         [1] It is embarrassing to do Missouri first.  We wanted people         
    to be able to compare our files with the source documents easily,           
    to see what we had coded.  In the process of coding the Missouri            
    data, however, the research assistant sorted all of the original            
    data by year and code.  This, unfortunately, makes it more                  
    difficult to compare the raw data files with the original                   
    sources, but it can be done.
