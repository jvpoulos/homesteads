         This is preliminary data covering 95 counties and 84 cities            
    governments throughout the 19th century.                                    
                                                                                
                                                                                
         The data in this study are made available through ICPSR.               
    They were originally collected by Richard Sylla, John Legler, and           
    John Wallis.  Neither the original investigators, the National              
    Bureau of Economic Research, or ICPSR bear any responsibility for           
    the analysis or interpretations presented here.  Nor are they               
    responsible for any uses to which this data may be put.                     
                                                                                
         Individuals receiving and using this data are strongly urged           
    to inform the ICPSR and the principle investigators of any errors           
    or discrepancies discovered during the use of this data.  In                
    order to provide agencies with essential information about the              
    use of archival sources and to facilitate the exchange of                   
    information, each user is expected to send two copies of                    
    completed manuscripts (or thesis) ICPSR of work based on these              
    data.                                                                       
                                                                                
         This data set reports fiscal data for 95 counties and 84               
    cities over the course of the 19th century.  These data were                
    taken from a wide variety of sources, including newspaper                   
    reports, reports of Selectmen, reports of county and city                   
    Treasurer's, and the like.  They have been integrated into the              
    coding scheme used in our other 19th and 20th century state and             
    local data sets.                                                            
                                                                                
         We have tried to construct local government data at decade             
    intervals, not on an annual basis.  (This is consistent with our            
    local government data for the 20th century, taken from census               
    sources.)  In practice, this meant taking local government data,            
    where we could find it, at the year closest to the census year.             
    As a result, the current series is spread over a wide number of             
    years, bunched around the census years.                                     
                                                                                
         At the present time the data themselves are reliable, that             
    is, the coding and numbers are unlikely to change.  They are,               
    however, something of an eclectic sample.  As you will see, New             
    England and Georgia are over represented at the present.  This is           
    due to the abundant local government materials at Littauer                  
    Library, and John Legler's residence in Georgia.                            
                                                                                
         The cities and counties covered in this release are listed             
    in Tables 5 and 6.                                                          
                                                                                
         We are currently working on the late 19th century census               
    sources on local governments, as well as the various WPA                    
    documents inventories, which are particularly rich in county                
    data.  These sources will be released as they become available.             
                                                                                
                                                                                
                                                                                
    Data Collection and Coding                                                  
                                                                                
         We began collecting data with two objectives in mind.  The             
    first was to make our categories consistent with the existing               
    categories used by the census in the 20th century, so that we can           
    match our data with theirs.  The second was to facilitate the               
    collection of the data.  This was particularly important since we           
    typically face the problem of too much rather than too little               
    information.  A method for organizing detail without losing                 
    information was of primary importance.                                      
                                                                                
         The solution adopted resembles the standard industrial                 
    classification (SIC) codes. Expenditures, revenues, and debt are            
    given one-digit classifications; major categories that match the            
    major 20th-century categories are given two-digit                           
    classifications; minor categories that correspond to the special            
    features of 19th- and/or 20th-century features of government are            
    given three-digit codes.                                                    
                                                                                
         No coding scheme can be completely consistent with the                 
    census classifications, since the census has continually changed            
    its classifications over the twentieth century.   We, therefore,            
    started with the major divisions of revenues and expenditures               
    from the Census of Governments after 1960.  To that we added the            
    major revenue and expenditure categories from the census for                
    early part of the century excluded as categories after 1950.  The           
    result is the major categories listed in Tables 1 and 2.  These             
    are the major two-digit classifications.                                    
                                                                                
                                                                                
         Finer classifications, taken from actual census categories             
    and from our own experience with the 19th century data, make up a           
    set of three-digit categories.  The three digit categories are              
    subsets of the two-digit categories.  In other words, the sum of            
    all of the three-digit categories associated with a particular              
    two-digit category, is the total for that two-digit category.  So           
    the sum of the three digit codes 2110 through 2190, is equal to             
    the total for the two-digit code 2100.  The three-digit codes are           
    shown in Tables 3 and 4.                                                    
                                                                                
         In practice, the raw data is very heterogeneous.  In the               
    case of our state series, where we collected annual series for              
    each state, we constructed unique four digit codes for each                 
    states.  For many of the cities and counties, we were only able             
    to uncover data on total expenditures or revenues.  In most other           
    places the level of detail is fairly limited.  As a result we               
    limited the coding to the three-digit level reported in Tables 3            
    and 4.                                                                      
                                                                                
         This data set also includes some information on long-term              
    debt and assessed property values, but only for counties.  Long-            
    term debt is coded 5000, and assessed property values in the                
    8000s.

         The data is organized in a database format, not in tables.             
    Each value for expenditures, revenues, debt, or assessed value is           
    represented by a observation in the data set.  All the files are            
    ASCII text files, using comma and quote delimiters.  Each                   
    observation includes the dollar amount of the expenditure or                
    revenue, and three identifiers: state, year, type of government,            
    and ISO (ISO is the Code).

         There are six data files.  Two files, CITYREV.TXT and                  
    CITYEXP.TXT, report city revenues and expenditures, respectively.           
    Two other files, COUNTREV.TXT and COUNTEXP.TXT report county                
    revenues and expenditures, respectively.  The file CNDEBT.TXT               
    reports county debt totals, where available.  And the final file,           
    CNASSESS.TXT reports property tax assessments.                              
                                                                                
         Each of the expenditure and revenue files contains three               
    panels.  Each panel contains information on a different level of            
    aggregation, given in descending order of aggregation.                     
         The first panel gives the revenue totals, this is the 1-               
    digit panel. The ISO code for total revenues is "1".  There is a            
    blank line at the end of the 1-digit panel.  The ISO codes are              
    literally "1 digit" long.                                                   
                                                                                
         The 2-digit panel includes all 2-digit ISO codes (for                  
    revenues they all start with 1 or 2, for expenditures with 3 or             
    4).  There is a blank line at the end of the 2-digit panel.                 
    Again, the ISO codes are literally 2 digits long.                           
                                                                                
         The 3-digit panel includes all 3-digit ISO codes (for                  
    revenues they all start with 1 or 2, for expenditures with 3 or             
    4).  Again, the ISO codes are literally 3 digits long.                      
                                                                                
         Because of the structure of the data, the values given for             
    the 2-digit categories sum to the 1-digit totals, and the same is           
    true for the 3-digit categories.  Before you use the data                   
    remember to separate the panels.  If you total all of the codes             
    for each state, you will get three times total revenue or                   
    expenditure.                                                                
                                                                                
         There are no panels in the debt and assessed value files.              
                                                                                
                                                                                
    CAVEATS                                                                     
                                                                                
    Important Caveats                                                           
                                                                                
         There are several things you should be aware of:                       
                                                                                
         - Total Revenues have the code "1" and Total Expenditures              
    have the code "3".                                                          
                                                                                
         - Two- and three-digit revenues have codes that start with             
    the number "1" or "2"; two- and three-digit expenditures have               
    codes that start with the number "3" or "4".  So adding up all of           
    the two digit codes from "10" to "19" will not give you total               
    revenues.                                                                   
                                                                                
         - There is a difference between 1000 numbers and 2000                  
    numbers.  They correspond to the categories of "tax" and                    
    "non-tax" revenues.  There is no comparable meaning to the 3000             
    and 4000 numbers.                                                           
                                                                                
         - Most of the two-digit codes are straightforward.  That is,           
    all of the three digit codes they encompass refer to related                
    aspects of fiscal activity.  On the other hand, some two-digit              
    codes encompass three-digit codes that have nothing to do with              
    each other.  This is particularly true for the "miscellaneous"              
    and "not elsewhere classified" categories 2900 and 3900.  If you            
    use the two-digit codes, it is wise to examine the underlying               
    three-digit codes.                                                          
                                                                                
         - Because this a preliminary data set there may be some                
    problems using three-digit codes.  You may find a three-digit               
    code in the data that is not listed in Table 3 or 4.  We can go             
    back to the original files and find out what the code is for you.           
                                                                                
                                                                                
         We hope that you will find the data set useful and would               
    appreciate you keeping us informed of the uses to which the data            
    is put.  Remember for now: CAVEAT EMPTOR.  We will speed clean              
    versions of the data to ISR as becomes available and, we hope,              
    will have a book explaining everything going on with the data               
    sometime soon.                                                              
                                                                                
         Any comments or suggestions will be greatly appreciated.
