     SUMMARY: This data collection  contains  financial  data  on  state        
     government  revenues  and  expenditures  for 16 states during 1933-        
     1937.   There  are  separate  files   for   different   levels   of        
     aggregation:   (1)  revenue  and  expenditure  aggregates  (1-digit        
     codes), (2) revenues and expenditures  classified  by  major  20th-        
     century  categories  (2-digit codes), (3) revenues and expenditures        
     classified by minor categories that correspond to special  features        
     of  19th-  and/or 20th-century governments (3-digit codes), and (4)        
     revenues and expenditures classified  by  idiosyncratic  categories        
     which  differ  from  state  to  state (4-digit categories). Parts 1        
     through 4 contain expenditure data.  Parts  5  through  8  comprise        
     revenue   data.  Part  9  contains  codes  for  the  categories  of        
     expenditures and revenues.

         The Census Department began collecting state government                
    financial statistics annually in 1915.  The resulting series,               
    "Financial Statistics of States" was collected almost annually              
    from then on, with one significant break in from 1933 to 1936               
    (the series was not collected in 1920 and 1921).                            
                                                                                
         This data set is intended to fill that hole.  The current              
    data release includes information for 16 states.  Information for           
    other states is being collected and will be released as it                  
    becomes available.  If you are interested in data for a                     
    particular state not included in this release, please contact

    notes to the final release of the data.  This information is                
    available from us if you need it.                                           
                                                                                
                                                                                
    Data Collection and Coding                                                  
                                                                                
         We began collecting data with two objectives in mind.  The             
    first was to make our categories consistent with the existing               
    categories used by the census in the 20th century, so that we can           
    match our data with theirs.  The second was to facilitate the               
    collection of the data.  This was particularly important since we           
    typically face the problem of too much rather than too little               
    information.  A method for organizing detail without losing                 
    information was of primary importance.                                      
                                                                                
         The solution adopted resembles the standard industrial                 
    classification (SIC) codes. Expenditures, revenues, and debt are            
    given one-digit classifications; major categories that match the            
    major 20th-century categories are given two-digit                           
    classifications; minor categories that correspond to the special            
    features of 19th- and/or 20th-century features of government are            
    given three-digit codes; and idiosyncratic divisions, which                 
    differ from state to state are given unique four-digit codes in             
    each state.  This allows us to design a classification (coding)             
    scheme for each state at the four-digit level that can be                   
    aggregated into two- and three-digit categories that are                    
    identical for every state by using a simple sorting program.                
                                                                                
         No coding scheme can be completely consistent with the                 
    census classifications, since the census has continually changed            
    its classifications over the twentieth century.   We, therefore,            
    started with the major divisions of revenues and expenditures               
    from the Census of Governments after 1960.  To that we added the            
    major revenue and expenditure categories from the census for                
    early part of the century excluded as categories after 1950.  The           
    result is the major categories listed in Tables 1 and 2.  These             
    are the major two-digit classifications.                                    
                                                                                
                                                                                
         Finer classifications, taken from actual census categories             
    and from our own experience with the 19th century data, make up a           
    set of three-digit categories.  The three digit categories are              
    subsets of the two-digit categories.  In other words, the sum of            
    all of the three-digit categories associated with a particular              
    two-digit category, is the total for that two-digit category.  So           
    the sum of the three digit codes 2110 through 2190, is equal to             
    the total for the two-digit code 2100.  The three-digit codes are           
    shown in Tables 3 and 4.                                                    
                                                                                
         In practice, the raw data is very heterogeneous.  States               
    called similar financial items by different names, different                
    items by similar names, and classified debt and intragovernmental           
    transfers in different ways.  Therefore, a unique set of                    
    four-digit classifications was created for each state.  That is,            
    while all of the one-, two-, and three-digit codes are the same             
    in every state, the four-digit codes are different for every                
    state.                                                                      
                                                                                
         We begin the collection process by assigning a four-digit              
    code to every line entry on revenues and expenditures in the                
    source document. The raw financial data and the codes were then             
    entered into a spreadsheet file using Lotus.  The data were then            
    transferred to a Paradox database file where the data are sorted            
    and aggregated by code.  Then totals for each of the three-digit            
    classifications are calculated.  Since the three-digit                      
    classifications are the same for every state, we then have                  
    comparable financial statistics for every state.                            
                                                                                
         REMEMBER: The four-digit codes are not comparable across               
    states.  The "CODE.TXT" file gives you access to all of the codes           
    used in each state for the 1930s.

         The data is organized in a database format, not in tables.             
    Each number in the Census is represented by a observation in the            
    data set.  These are ASCII text files, using comma and quote                
    delimiters.  Each observation includes the dollar amount of the             
    expenditure or revenue, and three identifiers: state, year, and             
    ISO (ISO is the Code).

         There are eight data files.  Four are revenue files and four           
    are expenditure files.  Each data files represents a different

         The data files 30REV1.TXT and 30EXP1.TXT present data on

         The data files 30REV2.TXT and 30EXP2.TXT present data at the           
    2-digit level of aggregation; the files 30REV3.TXT and 30EXP3.TXT           
    at the 3-digit level of aggregation; and the files 30REV4.TXT and           
    30EXP4.TXT at the 4-digit level of aggregation. (Note that the 4-           
    digit data is aggregated, that is, if a state had four entries in           
    a 4-digit code, they will be summed together.  As a result, you             
    cannot compare 30EXP4.TXT with the original source documents.               
    The final release of the data will include completely                       
    disaggregated data that is comparable to the source documents.)             
                                                                                
         A ninth file contains information on the codes.  This is               
    contained in the file CODE.TXT.  This data set contains all of              
    the codes used in each state.  Its structure is:

    ===========================================                                 
                                                                                
         This file has three variables, "YEAR", "ISO" (the code                 
    number), and the "CODE TEXT".  The code text is the title given             
    to each expenditure or revenue category in each state.  "CODE               
    TEXT" may vary, therefore, between states for the same code.                
                                                                                
         Note: There are no codes for Nevada.

    Important Caveats                                                           
                                                                                
         There are several things you should be aware of, even when             
    there are not any problems with the underlying data:                        
                                                                                
         - Total Revenues have the code "1" and Total Expenditures              
    have the code "3".                                                          
                                                                                
         - Two- and three-digit revenues have codes that start with             
    the number "1" or "2"; two- and three-digit expenditures have               
    codes that start with the number "3" or "4".  So adding up all of           
    the two digit codes from "10" to "19" will not give you total               
    revenues.                                                                   
                                                                                
         - There is a difference between 1000 numbers and 2000                  
    numbers.  They correspond to the early 20th century categories of           
    "tax" and "non-tax" revenues.  There is no comparable meaning to            
    the 3000 and 4000 numbers.                                                  
                                                                                
         - Most of the two-digit codes are straightforward.  That is,           
    all of the three digit codes they encompass refer to related                
    aspects of fiscal activity.  On the other hand, some two-digit              
    codes encompass three-digit codes that have nothing to do with              
    each other.  This is particularly true for the "miscellaneous"              
    and "not elsewhere classified" categories 2900 and 3900.  If you            
    use the two-digit codes, it is wise to examine the underlying               
    three-digit codes.                                                          
                                                                                
         - Because this a preliminary data set there may be some                
    problems using three-digit codes.  You may find a three-digit               
    code in the data that is not listed in Table 3 or 4.  We can go             
    back to the original files and find out what the code is for you.           
                                                                                
                                                                                
         There is another set of substantive caveats that the wary              
    user must keep in mind.                                                     
                                                                                
         - This is preliminary data.  The data has been carefully               
    checked for errors in transcription and coding, undoubtedly some            
    remain, but they are not systematic.  There are, however,                   
    systematic errors in coding that occur when a research assistant            
    uses the wrong code unwittingly; when one of the PI's makes a               
    mistake in telling an RA how something should be coded; or when             
    we misunderstand (or simply don't understand) what an line entry            
    is in a particular state report.  This is the best we could do in           
    the first pass through the data.  We do not guarantee that the              
    coding will not change.                                                     
                                                                                
                                                                                
         - There is no adjustment for fiscal years.  This has two               
    dimensions to it.  First, states periodically changed the end               
    dates on their fiscal years.  This produced some nine month                 
    fiscal years and some 15 month fiscal years.  When possible we              
    adjusted for this in the original coding (when it was possible to           
    break out quarterly expenditures and revenues, for example).  In            
    other cases we simply have to take what is given to us.  In time,           
    we will make adjustments to the data (probably some type of                 
    weighted linear interpolation), but these data do not include any           
    such adjustments.                                                           
                                                                                
         Of the 16 states covered in this release, two states Idaho             
    and Illinois, were on two year fiscal calendars.  This makes                
    those two states a bit different.                                           
                                                                                
         Idaho:  Idaho reported biennial expenditures, which we have            
    included for the years 1933, 1935, and 1937.  The 1933 year                 
    covers 1933 and 1934, the 1935 year covers 1935 and 1936, and the           
    1937 year covers 1937 and 1938.                                             
                                                                                
         The bigger problem with Idaho is that the state did not                
    report revenues by source.  Instead the state reported revenues             
    by "fund," that is, whether the revenues went into the school               
    fund, the general fund, etc.  We have not coded any of this                 
    information as yet.  So there is no information for Idaho                   
    revenues.                                                                   
                                                                                
         Illinois:  Illinois was also on a biennial calendar.  It               
    reported expenditures for each two year period, 1933, 1935, and             
    1937 as in Idaho.  The state also reported annual revenues.  So             
    the revenue data for Illinois are annual, and the expenditure               
    data for Illinois are biennial.                                             
                                                                                
         Nevada: Remember, there are no codes in "CODE.TXT" for                 
    Nevada.                                                                     
                                                                                
         We hope that you will find the data set useful and would               
    appreciate you keeping us informed of the uses to which the data            
    is put.  Remember for now: CAVEAT EMPTOR.  We will speed clean              
    versions of the data to ISR as becomes available and, we hope,              
    will have a book explaining everything going on with the data               
    sometime soon.                                                              
                                                                                
         Any comments or suggestions will be greatly appreciated.
