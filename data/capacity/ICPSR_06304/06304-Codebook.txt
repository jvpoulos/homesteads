     OF  FUNDS,  CENSUS  STATISTICS,  TWENTIETH  CENTURY  [THROUGH 1982]        
     (ICPSR 6304)                                                               
                                                                                
     SUMMARY: This data collection contains fiscal data on revenues  and        
     expenditures  of  state, county, and other local governments (urban        
     governments of certain sizes,  school  districts,  etc.)  in  1902,        
     1913,  1932,  1942,  1962,  1972,  and 1982. Variables in this data        
     collection include state, year, type of government, and the  dollar        
     amount of the revenue or expenditure at four levels of aggregation:        
     (1) total expenditures and  revenues,  (2)  major  categories  that        
     match   the  major  20th-century  categories  of  expenditures  and        
     revenues, (3) minor categories that correspond to special  features        
     of 19th- and/or 20th-century governments, and (4) and idiosyncratic        
     categories that differ from state to state.                                
                                                                                
     UNIVERSE:  State,  county,  and  other  local  governments   (urban

         The data in this study are made available through ICPSR.               
    They were originally collected by Richard Sylla, John Legler, and           
    John Wallis.  Neither the original investigators, the National              
    Bureau of Economic Research, or ICPSR bear any responsibility for           
    the analysis or interpretations presented here.  Nor are they               
    responsible for any uses to which this data may be put.                     
                                                                                
         Individuals receiving and using this data are strongly urged           
    to inform the ICPSR and the principle investigators of any errors           
    or discrepancies discovered during the use of this data.  In                
    order to provide agencies with essential information about the              
    use of archival sources and to facilitate the exchange of                   
    information, each user is expected to send two copies of                    
    completed manuscripts (or thesis) ICPSR of work based on these              
    data.                                                                       
                                                                                
                                                                                
         Over the twentieth century the Census Department collected             
    information on government expenditures, revenues, and debt at               
    somewhat irregular intervals.  The information collected,                   
    however, varies significantly from census to census. This data              
    set fills the need for a state level series on state and local              
    fiscal activity for the twentieth century.  It is part of our               
    larger effort to construct state level information for state and            
    local fiscal activity from 1787 to the present.                             
                                                                                
         The first comprehensive attempt to measure all government              
    activity in the United States was undertaken in 1902 and                    
    published in the Census volume Wealth, Debt, and Taxation [1].              
    This was followed by a similar census in 1913, which collected              
    information from all governments in incorporated places with a              
    population greater than 2,500 (including all county governments).           
    In 1922, the Census limited its local government collection to              
    tax revenues only, excluding all expenditures and non-tax                   
    revenues.  There were censuses in 1932 and 1942.  These censuses            
    were virtually complete in coverage (with gaps in 1932 for                  
    expenditure detail in "towns and cities" in 28 states), but                 
    reported more limited detail on fiscal categories.  The "Census             
    of Government" series resumed in 1957, and has continued at five            
    year intervals up to the present.  We have taken the original               
    reported census data for the years 1902, 1913, 1932, 1942, 1962,            
    1972, and 1982.                                                             
                                                                                
         In order for you to use this information effectively it is             
    necessary to understand where the data came from and how we have            
    categorized it.  We begin with a brief description of how the               
    data files are organized.  The next section describes our                   
    classification scheme and relates it to the Census                          
    classification.  The fourth section discusses the problems in               
    constructing consistent measures of fiscal activity over the                
    course of the century.  In that section we talk about what you              
    need to do to create a comparable series for the entire century,            
    but we do not include any data in this data set that has been               
    "fixed" in any way.  This data set is intended to reflect, as               
    accurately as possible, the original census documents.                      
                                                                                
                                                                                
                                                                                
    Form of Machine Readable Data                                               
                                                                                
         The data is organized in a database format, not in tables.             
    Each number in the Census is represented by a observation in the            
    data set.  These are ASCII text files, using comma and quote                
    delimiters.  Each observation includes the dollar amount of the             
    expenditure or revenue, and four identifiers: state, year, type,            
    and ISO (ISO is the Code).

         VALUE = the dollar amount of the revenue or expenditure.               
                                                                                
         There are seven data files, one for each year.  These files            
    are named ****DATA.ISR, where **** is 1902, 1913, 1932, 1942,               
    1962, 1972, or 1982.  Each data file has three panels.                      
                                                                                
         The first panel is ten to twelve lines.  It gives the source           
    of the data, the number of observations, and the variable names.            
                                                                                
         The second panel, reports total revenues (ISO = 1) and total           
    expenditures (ISO = 3), for each state and level of government.             
                                                                                
         The third panel reports details for each level of government           
    in each state.  The panels are separated by blank lines.  With a            
    few exceptions, discussed below, the data in the third panel sum            
    to the data in the second panel.  Remember to separate the panels           
    before you use them.  If you add up revenues before separating              
    the panels, you will get twice the actual revenue total.                    
                                                                                
         Please note that the numbers correspond to the numbers                 
    published in the Census.  For 1902 and 1913, the numbers are                
    dollar figures.  For 1932 and later, the numbers are in thousands           
    of dollars.                                                                 
                                                                                
         The actual Census data census is the "VALUE" variable.  The            
    following section describes our coding scheme and how you can               
    access and organize the data sets.                                          
                                                                                
         For reference, the number of observations in each years data           
    file should be:                                                             
         1902 = 8,064                                                           
         1913 = 5,664                                                           
         1932 = 9,744                                                           
         1942 = 4,224                                                           
         1962 = 8,064                                                           
         1972 = 8,064                                                           
         1982 = 7,680                                                           
                                                                                
                                                                                
                                                                                
         There is an eighth data set, named CODES.ISR.  This variable           
    contains all of the codes used in each of the seven years.  Its             
    structure is different:                                                     
                                                                                
    ===========================================                                 
    YEAR      ISO       CODE TEXT                                               
    ===========================================                                 
                                                                                
         This file has three variables, "YEAR", "ISO" (the code                 
    number), and the "CODE TEXT".  As will be explained below, the              
    code text is the title given to each expenditure or revenue                 
    category by the census.  So the same code can have slightly                 
    different code texts associated with it in different years.  By             
    combining the CODES.ISR as a database with the individual year              
    files it is simple to identify what each observation in the year            
    files represents.  Note that not every code appears in every year.

    expenditures are presented in Table 1.                                      
                                                                                
         The census continually altered the categories it used to               
    organize fiscal data.  The categories used in 1902, for example,            
    are not the same as the categories in 1982.  The census dealt               
    with these changes by recasting the earlier censuses in terms of            
    the later census's categories.  Unfortunately, published                    
    documents present national aggregate totals for state and local             
    fiscal activity, there are no comparable state level numbers.               
    The difficulties in constructing a state level series are                   
    formidable, but not insurmountable.                                         
                                                                                
         We are interested, of course, not only in constructing                 
    consistent fiscal accounts for the twentieth century, but also              
    for linking the 20th century Census information to our 19th                 
    century data.  We designed a classification scheme flexible                 
    enough to classify the actions of states between 1800 and 1982.             
    We also wanted a design compatible with different ways of                   
    organizing and presenting the data -- specifically, consistent              
    with the census classifications used between 1902 and 1982.                 
                                                                                
         The solution we adopted resembles the standard industrial              
    classification (SIC) codes. Expenditures, revenues, and debt are            
    given one-digit classifications; major categories that match the            
    major 20th-century categories are given two-digit                           
    classifications; minor categories that correspond to the special            
    features of 19th- and/or 20th-century features of government are            
    given three-digit codes; and idiosyncratic divisions, which                 
    differ from state to state are given unique four-digit codes in             
    each state.  This allows us to design a classification (coding)             
    scheme for each state at the four-digit level that can be                   
    aggregated into two- and three-digit categories that are                    
    identical for every state by using a simple sorting program.                
                                                                                
         We started with the major divisions of revenues and                    
    expenditures from the Census of Governments after 1962.  To that            
    we added the major revenue and expenditure categories from the              
    census for early part of the century excluded as categories after           
    1962.  The result is the major categories listed in Tables 2 and            
    3.  These are the "two-digit" classifications.                              
                                                                                
         Finer classifications, taken from actual census categories             
    and from our own experience with the 19th and 20th century data,            
    make up a set of three-digit categories.  The three digit                   
    categories are subsets of the two-digit categories.  In other               
    words, the sum of all of the three-digit categories associated              
    with a particular two-digit category, is the total for that two-            
    digit category.  So the sum of the three digit codes 2510 through           
    2590, is equal to the total for the two-digit code 2500.                    
                                                                                
         For our 19th century data the four-digit codes are unique to           
    each state.  In this data set all of the data was taken from                
    Census sources, so every state shares the same codes.  Four-digit           
    codes represent a level of detail presented in one or more years,           
    but not in all years.  For example, the 2500 code reports                   
    "Transportation Rents and Privileges."  In the early years this             
    was reported as a total, and we have coded it 2500.  In 1962 and            
    later, the revenues are broken down in finer detail.  The                   
    category 2520 reports earnings of airports, 2540 reports earnings           
    of water transportation and terminals, and 2551 parking                     
    facilities.  Each has its own four-digit code when it appears,              
    and those four-digit codes are unique.                                      
                                                                                
         There is no simple or compact way to describe all of the               
    codes.  Since every attempt has been made to report numbers that            
    are actually found in the sources you can reorganize the data               
    however you wish.  Sections that follow discuss problems of                 
    comparability over time.  You may want to use in modifying the              
    original data, but we have made any modifications to the data in            
    this data set.  There is, however, one important way that our               
    data differs from the original Census sources.                              
                                                                                
         We wanted our revenue numbers for individual functions to              
    add up to total revenue, and the same for expenditures.  The                
    Census tables, of course, include lots of sub-totals, and                   
    including the sub-totals and then summing up all of the revenue             
    items produces a sum greater than total revenues.  One might                
    think it you can just record the individual line items from the             
    census, but it isn't that easy.  Some of the census sub-totals              
    are totals of more data than is presented in the tables; some               
    census sub-totals don't total to their constituent elements; and            
    some of the sub-totals are not supported by any detail at all.              
    Sometimes, therefore, it was necessary to make calculations of              
    our own to supplement the published census data.                            
                                                                                
         There are a few cases where the census numbers just don't              
    add up.  If you sum the detailed revenue numbers from the third             
    panel of each data file and compare it to the total revenue from            
    the second panel, you will find that the numbers are not equal in           
    35 instances, all but one of them in 1962 and 1972.  This                   
    results, primarily, from the fact that the reported Census                  
    figures for those years were rounded and do not add.  Only four             
    states have discrepancies larger than 3 or 4 (thousand) dollars:            
    Texas in 1962 is off by -10,000 thousand; Georgia in 1972 is off            
    by 122 thousand; Minnesota in 1972 is off by 30 thousand; and               
    South Carolina in 1972 is off by 10 thousand [2].  The exception is         
    Missouri in 1902, which is off by exactly 100,000.                          
                                                                                
         On the expenditure side, if you sum the detailed expenditure           
    numbers from the third panel of each data file and compare it to            
    the total expenditures from the second panel, you will find that            
    the numbers are not equal in 69 instances, all of them in 1962              
    and 1972, the years that were rounded and do not add up exactly.            
    Only four states have discrepancies larger than 3 or 4 (thousand)           
    dollars: Minnesota in 1962 is off by -1,999 thousand; South                 
    Dakota in 1962 is off by 3,999 thousand; Georgia in 1972 is off             
    by 101 thousand; and New Mexico is off by 10 thousand.                      
                                                                                
         These are census errors, not ours, and you can treat them              
    however you want, just don't pull out your hair trying to get the           
    components to add to the totals.  It is completely arbitrary to             
    assign the errors to one category or another (you can usually               
    narrow it down to some category - in Missouri in 1902 the mistake           
    is in General Government (ISO = 3600)).  One option is to put an            
    dove factor in Miscellaneous Revenues (ISO = 2900).                         
                                                                                
         The result of our coding efforts are found in Table 4.                 
    Table 4 is a very long table.  Each panel of the table presents a           
    two-digit revenue and expenditure category, and reports whether             
    or not a category corresponding to our two-digit category was               
    reported in each census year.  If there is no code for a year,              
    there was none published by the census.  The table lists the code           
    we assigned to the census number, and the title (or the "code               
    text") given to that number by the census.  The code text                   
    corresponds to the dock used in the docs census publications.               
    The file "CODES.ISR" is just Table 4, with the blank years taken            
    out, put in database format.                                                
                                                                                
         By holding this table in one hand and the census in the                
    other hand, you can figure out where each census category fits in           
    to our codes.  There are a few exceptions.  If we had to                    
    calculate a number, we will present a code for it but it will not           
    appear in the census source.  These variables are identified in             
    Table 4 as with a "C" in the third column.  In a few instances              
    you may find detail in the Census that we report at the sub-total           
    level.  Look closely and you will see that the details aren't               
    consistent with the totals, and we have chosen to take the totals           
    (for example, the Education revenues in 1962 and 1972).                     
                                                                                
         When the categories are not straightforward, additional                
    complications are noted in each of the table's panels.  It is               
    wise to pay close attention to the titles, particularly early in            
    the century.  For example, Interest revenues (ISO = 2910) appear            
    by themselves in 1902, 1962, 1972, and 1982.  In 1913 they appear           
    as "Interest and Rents" which we have still coded as 2910, but in           
    1932 they show up in "Highway Privileges, Rents, Interest."  We             
    have coded it as 2500, because of the Highway Privileges part,              
    but clearly it could be put in several places.  Do not infer that           
    state local government received no interest revenues in 1932 just           
    because the code 2910 isn't report din that year.  In other                 
    words, be careful.                                                          
                                                                                
         The second important identifier in the data set is "TYPE".             
    The censuses reported data at different levels of aggregation and           
    level of government in each census.  We were interested in the              
    major categories of state and local government.  Table 5 provides           
    information on the various types of government data reported in             
    each Census year, and whether we have included the details in               
    this data set.  With the exception of 1932, we limited our                  
    collection efforts into what was necessary to construct total               
    local government.  If the total was available we did not collect            
    the detail by level of government.                                          
                                                                                
                                                                                
                                                                                
    Creating a Comparable Series across Time                                    
                                                                                
         The consistency of the data series over time depends, in               
    part, on the level of detail you wish to examine.  Total revenues           
    and total expenditures are not too bad.  As you move to more                
    specific functions, however, the difficulties mount.  Some of the           
    problems are clear from an examination of the codes and titles in           
    table 4.  Other problems are more systematic.  This discussion is           
    necessarily brief.  A more detailed treatment of the issues can             
    be found in various Census publications, particularly the "State            
    and Local Special Studies" published by the U.S. Bureau of the              
    Census and the post-1957 Census of Government volumes.  Special             
    Studies #25, #38, and #43 are particularly helpful.  The problems           
    divide themselves into two areas: concepts of total revenue and             
    expenditure, and the breakdown of revenues and expenditures by              
    function.                                                                   
                                                                                
    Fiscal Totals                                                               
                                                                                
         At the level of total revenues and expenditures the largest            
    problem is 1942.  As described in Special Study #25, in 1937 the            
    Census significantly changed the concept it used to measure                 
    government revenues and expenditures [3].  The census later                 
    reversed itself and, after 1950 returned, more or less, to the              
    pre-1937 concepts of revenues and expenditures.  The reversion is           
    described in detail in Special Study #32.  Two features are                 
    particularly important.                                                     
                                                                                
         Before 1937 government debt transactions were not treated as           
    part of revenues or expenditures.  That is, repayment of debt               
    principle and revenues from bond sales were not included in                 
    expenditures or revenues.  They were included in the reports, but           
    under separate title.  In the 1942 Census of governments this was           
    reversed, and "Provision for Debt Repayment" (ISO = 4100) was               
    included in the 1942 expenditure totals.  The policy was reversed           
    again after 1950.  To make expenditure totals comparable over               
    time, therefore, it is a relative simple to deduct the Provision            
    for Debt Repayment from the 1942 total expenditure.                         
                                                                                
         The second problem is more difficult: the earnings and                 
    expenditures of "public service enterprises."  These enterprises            
    include public utilities (water, gas, electricity, and transit)             
    and liquor stores [4].  In 1902, 1913, 1932 and again from 1962             
    onwards, gross receipts of utilities and liquor stores are                  
    counted as revenues and gross expenditures are counted as                   
    expenditures.  In 1942, these amounts only appear as part of the            
    expenditure category "Contributions to trust funds and                      
    enterprises," (ISO = 3800).  From the breakdown by levels of                
    government it is clear that the bulk of this category is the                
    "trust fund" portion, primarily unemployment and pension fund               
    contributions.  The public enterprise part of this category has             
    been netted out almost entirely.                                            
                                                                                
         Special Study #32 presents information on public service               
    enterprise revenues and expenditures for State governments for              
    1942.  It clear from the discussion on "Sources and Methods" that           
    these estimates were based in part on "detailed worksheets and              
    records" from the original census of 1942 and in part on some               
    estimation and interpolation.  Unfortunately, the bulk of public            
    service enterprises are operated by local governments, and                  
    similar estimates for local governments were not been made (at              
    least we haven't found them yet).                                           
                                                                                
         The third problem is the incomplete coverage of the 1913               
    Census (the 1922 Census is so incomplete we have not included it            
    here).  In 1913 the Census did not collect information from                 
    incorporated places with populations of less than 2,500.  This              
    one is very difficult, because there isn't a real satisfactory              
    way to estimate the size, particularly by individual functions,             
    for the government of those "other minor civil divisions."  A               
    simple way to estimate the under 2,500 revenues and expenditures            
    is simply to take the revenues (expenditures) of incorporated               
    placed under 2,500 as a ratio of total local government                     
    (excluding the under 2,500 portion) in 1902.  Then multiply total           
    local revenues (expenditures) in 1913 times the 1902 ratio.  The            
    data provided here enables you to perform that simple estimate.             
    This could be refined by adjusting for population size by size of           
    place of residence in 1900 and 1910.                                        
                                                                                
         A more complicated option is to use the 1902 Census to                 
    calculate the ratio of revenues (expenditures) in "other minor              
    civil divisions" with the total revenues (expenditures) of all              
    places with populations between 2,500 and 8,000 (This number                
    isn't directly reported in the 1902 Census, but it can be                   
    calculated from the categories that were reported).  Since the              
    1913 census does report revenues (expenditures) for incorporated            
    places with populations 2,500 to 8,000, you can estimate the 1913           
    total for places with less than 2,500 by applying the 1902 ratio.           
    Again, this calculation could be made more accurate by adjusting            
    the 1902 ratios for the change in the size distribution of                  
    population by size of place of residence from the 1900 and 1910             
    census.                                                                     
                                                                                
    Functional Breakdowns                                                       
                                                                                
         The problems with total revenues and expenditures are not              
    too bad, and occur in 1942 and 1913.  The problems with                     
    constructing consistent functional categories are more difficult,           
    and while 1942 is still a problem year, there are other difficult           
    years as well.                                                              
                                                                                
         One type of problem arises from the level of detail provided           
    in each census.  For example, because of budgetary problems and             
    the onset of the war, the 1942 census provides very little detail           
    on revenues by function.  Basically we have total taxes - which             
    can be divided into property taxes (ISO = 1110) and all other               
    taxes (ISO = 1900); Aid from other governments (ISO = 2300, 2350,           
    2361, and 2362); and Charges and Miscellaneous (ISO = 2900).                
    That is all there is.  Any comparable functional categories for             
    the entire century are limited to those four revenue categories,            
    otherwise 1942 must be dropped.                                             
                                                                                
         Let us emphasize, it depends on what level of aggregation              
    you are interested in.  If you want total revenues, 1942 is fine.           
    If you want property and non-property taxes, 1942 is fine.                  
    Likewise for the tax and non-tax revenue distinction.                       
                                                                                
         Similarly, in 1913 and 1932 the Census reported expenditures           
    for "Charities, Hospitals, and Corrections."  This category                 
    included all of the social welfare expenditures (ISO = 3200) and            
    what today we would include under public safety for correction              
    facilities and programs (ISO = 3430).  In 1902 there was a                  
    distinct category for "Penal Institutions" (ISO = 3430); in 1942            
    there was just "Other Public Safety" (ISO = 3409) with no                   
    specific mention of corrections; and from 1962 to 1982                      
    Corrections is always a distinct category (ISO = 3430).                     
                                                                                
         The final general problem concerns capital outlays.  Before            
    1957, the Census reported a total for capital outlays separate              
    from other expenditures.  In 1962 and 1972 the Census reported              
    expenditures for individual expenditures that included detail for           
    capital outlays and for operations and maintenance.  In 1982 the            
    Census reported functional expenditures without distinguishing              
    between capital outlays and operations and maintenance (although            
    it is possible to obtain those numbers elsewhere in the census).            
                                                                                
         The problem for 1902, 1913, 1932, and 1942 is that you know            
    what capital outlays were in total, but not how much were for               
    education, highways, etc.  There is some supporting detail on               
    capital outlay by function in the individual censuses.   But in             
    no year is it complete.  It is possible to generate several                 
    plausible allocations of the capital outlay expenditures between            
    functions.  We have tried several alternatives, and can provide             
    you with sources and data.  At the moment we have yet to settle             
    on the best way to do it.                                                   
                                                                                
         A number of smaller problems are discussed in the notes to             
    Table 4, which you should follow carefully if you are interested            
    in a particular expenditure or revenue category.  As a general              
    rule, the 1902 Census was quite good and detailed.  The 1913,               
    1932, and 1942 provided limited detail.  The 1962, 1972, and 1982           
    Censuses provide lots of detail.  If you stick with our two-digit           
    categories as listed in Tables 2 and 3 and detailed in Table 4,             
    you won't go too far wrong.                                                 
                                                                                
         We hope that you will find the data set useful and would               
    appreciate you keeping us informed of the uses to which the data            
    is put.  We have assembled several versions of this data set with           
    "fixes" for the major problems.  We are willing to send you                 
    copies or talk about them, but until we decide on the final form            
    of the fixes we have not put them at ICPSR.  Any comments or                
    suggestions you have will be greatly appreciated.

    Note: In 1942 the Census reports two numbers for Aid received               
    from other Governments: "Total" and "From State Governments                 
    only."  We have assumed that the state only receives aid from the           
    federal government, an inaccurate assumption, but not to far                
    wrong.  Local government revenue from the federal government,               
    (ISO = 2350) is "total" aid minus "Aid from State governments               
    only" (which is ISO = 2361).                                                
                                                                                
    Note also that post-1962 there are aid numbers for all three                
    levels of government.  But states do not receive aid from                   
    themselves (ISO = 2361), and local governments do not receive aid           
    from themselves (ISO = 2362).  This later is a bit abstract,                
    however, since some local governments, particularly school                  
    districts, do receive aid from other local governments.  The                
    census has netted out those transfers already.

    Note: In 1962, 1972, and 1982 the Census reports more detail on             
    Education revenues.  However, the details do not add up to the              
    sub-total.  This appears to be due to the fact that school lunch            
    sales are reported in gross terms.  We have included the sub-               
    total only.

    Note: Health expenditures have been included in "Environmental              
    and Housing" ISO = 3560, usually.  This is a sticky one.                    
    Expenditures for hospitals are usually bundled with social                  
    welfare programs.  Expenditures for public health programs are              
    occasionally bundled with sanitation expenditures (1913 and 1932            
    "Health and Sanitation" ISO = 3550, although it could be 3550).             
                                                                                
    The other combination occurs in 1942 when the category becomes              
    "Health and Hospitals" which we have coded ISO = 3560.                      
                                                                                
    The operative distinction here is "public health" which is                  
         environmental versus health assistance for individuals.
